the insertion sort works by picking the index of the
first element as the mininum value it then iterates over the 
list of elements and checks if the other element is 
lesser than the element at the minimimum index
if the element is less it stores the index as the new index of the minimum value
and after the inner loop iterates over all the elements it swaps the element at the stored
minimimum index to the first index and then locks the first index and 
then moves to the second index the inner loop iterates again to store the index of the 
less value and swaps after the inner loop iterates over all the elements
